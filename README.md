# Instructions
To open application, please follow these steps:
1. Please install a IDE, like Visual Studio Code.
https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install Python version 3 or above.
https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. In your code editor, run these commands in the terminal:
"pip install scratchattach",
"pip install art"
4. Double click the app.py file in Windows Explorer
(it should open the file in vs code)
5. Press a little play icon at the top right of your screen.

And there you have it, you now have ran the program!
Or if you dont want to follow all those steps, you can run it as a .exe file.
Just disable "Real Time Protection" on your PC, and then double click the exe.
If it says "Windows is Protecting your PC", just click "More Info" and then
click "Run Anyway".

I know that sounds really suspicious but the stupid Windows says its a virus.

# Modding
If you know how to do Python and know how to use
Scratch Attach, feel free to mod it however you want.
